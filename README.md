#### Controlling Your Soldier Units

##### Selecting

Press a unit to select it.  
Light blue squares: Available movements  
Red diamond-shaped marker: Attack range

##### Moving and Attacking

Move: Drag the unit onto a light blue square and release.  
Rock and tree tiles require a unit's full mobility for the turn.  
All other tile types cost one mobility point.  
Attack: Drag the unit onto an enemy within attack range and release.

After moving and attacking, a unit turns gray - indicating it can no longer perform any actions until the next turn.

##### Healing

Units automatically heal between enemy waves.

#### Inspecting Enemy Soldier Units

Press an enemy unit to view its attack range and mobility.

#### Leveling Up Soldier Units

Units gain experience by attacking enemies.  
When enough experience is earned, a unit automatically levels up and becomes stronger.

The unit’s level is shown in the upper-left corner of its icon.  
For example: cavalries from level 1 to 5:
